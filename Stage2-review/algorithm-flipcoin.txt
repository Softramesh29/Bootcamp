Algorithm :

Step 1 : Using RANDOM function write a program for multiple time of flip a coin and get a singletcombination
	Expected result :
		Head
		Tail
		Head
		Head

Step 2 : Count Head and Tail values and then stored that values in dictionary and call the values from Dictionary


Step 3 : Read the values from a dictionary and display the winning percentage of Head and winning percentage of Tail
	Expected result :
	EX:
		Winning percentage of head : 30
		Winning percentage of Tail : 10

Step 4 : Using RANDOM function write a program for multiple time of flip a two coins and get a doublet combination
        Expected result :
		HH
		HT
		TH
		TT

Step 5 : Count the values for each four combination and then stored that values in dictionary and call the values from dictionary

Step 6 : Read the values from a dictionary and display the winning percentage of HH, HT, TH and TT
        Expected result :
        EX:
                Winning percentage of HH : 30
                Winning percentage of HT : 10
		Winning percentage of TH : 50
                Winning percentage of TT : 30

Step 4 : Using RANDOM function write a program for multiple time of flip a two coins and get a triplet combination
        Expected result :
                HHH
                HHT
                HTH
                THH
		TTT
		TTH
		THT
		HTT

Step 5 : Count the values for each eight combination and then stored that values in dictionary and call the values from dictionary

Step 6 : Read the values from a dictionary and display the winning percentage of HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTT, TTH, THT AND HTT
        Expected result :
        EX:
                Winning percentage of HHH : 30
                Winning percentage of HHT : 10
                Winning percentage of HTH : 40
                Winning percentage of THH : 30
		Winning percentage of TTT : 30
                Winning percentage of TTH : 10
                Winning percentage of THT : 20
                Winning percentage of HTT : 30
